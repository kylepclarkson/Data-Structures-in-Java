# Mathematics Review
Mathematics and computer science are deeply connected. Once you get beyond the surface of computer science, a strong background in topics such as analysis, calculus, probability, etc. will take you a long way.

In this course we use **asymptotic analysis** as means to compare algorithms; to say that algorithm A is "better" than algorithm B.  This will require us to use **functions** (e.g. $y=f(x)$) which in turn will require us to use properties of certain functions and operations defined on them.

## Functions
A **function** $f$ is a mapping between two sets $X$ and $Y$. Given an element $x$ in $X$ (written $x \in X$), $f$ maps $x$ to an element in $Y$, denoted as $f(x)$. 

The sets $X$ and $Y$ are called the **domain** and **codomain** of $f$. For our purposes we will understand the domain to be the set of natural numbers $\mathcal{N} = {0, 1, 2, \ldots}$ and the codomain the set of all real positive numbers $\mathcal{R}^{+}$ .
