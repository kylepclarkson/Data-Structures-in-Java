# Data-Structures-in-Java (WIP)

This is a repository for a data strutures course with implementations in Java. 
I am currently working on the the presentation of the material in a video format (theory and coding) which will be uploaded to youtube soon!
Feel free to star the repo to keep up to date with its progress.
